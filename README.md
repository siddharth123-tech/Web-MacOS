# Web-MacOS
One day I thought I would recreate OS X as a way to learn random techniques, in a very unorthodox way. I realize this isn't a very original idea, it's just my take on it.  I attempted to follow the OS X Human Interface Guidelines as closely as possible for class naming conventions, while doing my best at keeping things "semantic", as if it was a regular website.  Flexbox made this thing possible with very little effort.  All windows and dock, are draggable, resizable and rearrangeable. Tabs are also rearrangeable. It's dependent on jQueryUI... for now.  You can consider your right click hijacked, as the right click context menu functions. Disable the function rightClickMenu(); around line 415 to get your mouse back so you can use your inspector :)  The icons came directly from the OS, at some point I'll probably make these into a sprite and optimize them...at some point.  The photos app (poorly) pulls my flickr feed. This is a good time to also mention that photography is not my strong suit..  Future goals: Add folder tree navigation to finder, create terminal app, finish Safari functionality (ability to use the address bar, tabs.. maybe bookmarks), contextual/system menus, system preferences.  There are TONS of bugs, I'm sure many that I haven't seen...
